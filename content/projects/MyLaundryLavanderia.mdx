Developed the user interface following best programming practices, SEO guidelines, and implemented event tracking for Google Ads and Pixel conversions. Additionally, I created a backend that allows customers to access information about their equipment usage after filling out a form.
Technologies used: React with Next (for UI),Tailwind, Node.js (for backend).
